# This test demonstrates how to use the ALFaceDetection module.
# Note that you might not have this module depending on your distribution
#
# - We first instantiate a proxy to the ALFaceDetection module
#     Note that this module should be loaded on the robot's naoqi.
#     The module output its results in ALMemory in a variable
#     called "FaceDetected"

# - We then read this ALMemory value and check whether we get
#   interesting things.
